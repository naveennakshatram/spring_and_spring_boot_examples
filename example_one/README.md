# First Example on Tightly Coupled in Java 

Tightly coupled means that classes or components are highly dependent on each other. If one class changes, the others might break or also need to change.


In this example when i pass a different class reference to GameRunner constructor, i have to change the code in GameRunner class also because of tightly coupled.
