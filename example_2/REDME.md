# Second Example on Loosely Coupled 

Loosely coupled means that classes or components are independent of each other â€” they work together, but do not depend directly on each otherâ€™s internal structure.

## ðŸ”— Loose Coupling vs Tight Coupling

| ðŸ”’ Tightly Coupled                  | ðŸ”“ Loosely Coupled                           |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Classes are directly connected      | Classes depend on interfaces or abstractions |
| Hard to modify/test                 | Easy to modify, extend, test                 |
| Less reusable                       | More reusable and maintainable               |
